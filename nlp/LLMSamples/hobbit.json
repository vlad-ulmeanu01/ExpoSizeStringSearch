    "One of the most iconic and extensive quotes that comes to mind from The Hobbit is the opening passage, which sets the tone for the entire story. It introduces us to the peaceful, comfortable life of Bilbo Baggins before he is swept up into the adventure of a lifetime: 'In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.' This quote is significant because it encapsulates the essence of Bilbo's character and his world. The hobbit-hole represents safety, coziness, and contentment—qualities that Bilbo values deeply at the beginning of the tale. This imagery also contrasts sharply with the dangers and discomforts he will face on his journey, highlighting his transformation from a reluctant adventurer to a courageous hero.",
    "This passage is also beloved by readers because of its simple yet evocative language, which draws them into Tolkien's richly imagined world right from the start. When I think of The Hobbit, one of the most memorable and extensive quotes that immediately comes to mind is Bilbo's riddle to Gollum during their famous riddle game in the dark tunnels beneath the Misty Mountains. This particular quote stands out because of its simplicity and the significance it carries in the story. It goes like this: 'This thing all things devours: Birds, beasts, trees, flowers; Gnaws iron, bites steel;Grinds hard stones to meal; Slays king, ruins town, And beats high mountain down.' The answer to the riddle is 'Time,' and it’s a pivotal moment in the book. This riddle encapsulates the idea that time is a force that affects everything and everyone, including Bilbo and Gollum. The scene itself is iconic, as it leads to Bilbo's acquisition of the One Ring, which becomes central not only to The Hobbit but to The Lord of the Rings trilogy as well. Additionally, the riddle game is a key turning point for Bilbo, where his wits and cleverness save his life, marking the beginning of his transformation from a simple hobbit into a resourceful and courageous adventurer.",
    "One of the most memorable and often-quoted passages from The Hobbit is the description of the entrance to the Lonely Mountain, which also introduces the riddle of the secret door. This passage captures the sense of mystery, adventure, and the deep history that permeates Tolkien's world: 'Standing near was a great stone with a thrush sitting on it, and as the sun was sinking, it released a piercing note, as if it had been a signal. And as if in answer, down from the mountain fell a single ray of red light through the opening. By its light, Bilbo saw the grey stone in the grass that held a hidden keyhole. Then Thorin stepped forward and drew the key that had been given him, and he put it in the hole. It fitted perfectly. Then he turned it and the door swung open, and they all passed through.' This passage is iconic because it marks the moment when the quest reaches its climax. The description is rich with symbolism: the thrush, the keyhole revealed by the setting sun, and the hidden door all contribute to the magical realism that defines Tolkien's work. The scene is filled with tension and expectation, perfectly capturing the sense of discovery and adventure that drives The Hobbit.",
    "One of the most memorable and extensive quotes from The Hobbit that often comes to mind is the iconic riddle spoken by Gollum during the famous Riddles in the Dark chapter: 'This thing all things devours: Birds, beasts, trees, flowers; Gnaws iron, bites steel; Grinds hard stones to meal; Slays king, ruins town, And beats high mountain down.' This riddle is particularly striking because it encapsulates the eerie and sinister atmosphere of Gollum's lair, the cunning and tension between Gollum and Bilbo, and the timelessness of the themes in Tolkien's work. The answer to the riddle is 'Time,' which is a concept that resonates deeply with the themes of change, aging, and the inevitable passage of time that permeates The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. This passage also exemplifies Tolkien's mastery of language and his ability to weave profound truths into the fabric of his storytelling, making it one of the most memorable quotes from the book.",
    "The quote that often comes to mind from The Hobbit is Bilbo Baggins' reflection on his journey and the nature of adventures. This passage captures the essence of the unexpected journey he embarked on and how it changed him. Here's the detailed quote: 'This is a story of how a Baggins had an adventure, and found himself doing and saying things altogether unexpected. He may have lost the neighbours’ respect, but he gained—well, you will see whether he gained anything in the end.' This quote is from the early part of the book, setting the tone for Bilbo's transformation from a comfort-loving hobbit into a brave adventurer. It encapsulates the theme of personal growth and the idea that adventures, while disruptive and challenging, lead to profound change and self-discovery. Another iconic quote that stands out, especially towards the end of the story, is when Bilbo reflects on the nature of home and the value of simple pleasures: 'If more of us valued food and cheer and song above hoarded gold, it would be a merrier world.' This quote is a powerful commentary on the themes of greed, wealth, and the simple joys of life, which resonate throughout the narrative, particularly in the context of the dragon Smaug's hoard and the conflicts that arise from it.",
    "One of the most iconic and extensive quotes from The Hobbit that comes to mind is the description of Bilbo's home in the opening chapter. It beautifully captures the cozy and inviting atmosphere of the Shire, setting the stage for the entire adventure: 'In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort. It had a perfectly round door like a porthole, painted green, with a shiny yellow brass knob in the exact middle. The door opened on to a tube-shaped hall like a tunnel: a very comfortable tunnel without smoke, with paneled walls, and floors tiled and carpeted, provided with polished chairs, and lots and lots of pegs for hats and coats – the hobbit was fond of visitors.' This passage not only introduces the reader to the homely and charming world of Bilbo Baggins but also subtly reflects the theme of comfort versus adventure that runs throughout the novel. Bilbo's home is a place of warmth and safety, a stark contrast to the wild and perilous journey he is about to embark on. The detailed description of the hobbit-hole, with its emphasis on comfort and order, serves as a perfect entry point into the world of Middle-earth.",
    "When I think of The Hobbit, the first quote that comes to mind is from the beginning of the book, when J.R.R. Tolkien introduces us to Bilbo Baggins and the comfort of his home: 'In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.' This passage is iconic because it sets the tone for the entire story, introducing the reader to the warmth and coziness of hobbit life, while also hinting at the adventure that is about to disrupt this peaceful existence. The detailed description of the hobbit-hole is rich with imagery, making it easy to visualize the snug, welcoming environment that Bilbo is so reluctant to leave.",
    "When I think of The Hobbit, the first quote that comes to mind is from Chapter 1, 'An Unexpected Party.' It's the moment when Bilbo Baggins, completely overwhelmed by the sudden arrival of dwarves in his cozy hobbit hole, expresses his dismay. The quote encapsulates Bilbo’s initial reluctance to leave the comfort of his home and venture into the unknown. Here’s the detailed passage: 'We don’t want any adventures here, thank you! You might try over The Hill or across The Water.' By this he meant that the conversation was at an end. This line is emblematic of Bilbo's character at the beginning of the story—an ordinary hobbit, fond of his quiet life, who has no interest in the dangerous and unpredictable world outside of the Shire. His polite but firm rejection of the idea of adventure contrasts sharply with the epic journey he eventually undertakes, making it a power",
     "When I think of The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien, a particularly memorable quote that comes to mind is from Bilbo Baggins’ encounter with Gollum in the dark depths of the Misty Mountains. This passage is famous for Bilbo’s discovery of the One Ring and his clever use of riddles to outwit Gollum: 'This is the riddle-game. Riddles are all we have to play with,' said Gollum. 'And I will be a riddle master. You have a good head on your shoulders, I can see that. You will have to answer the riddles in turn, or I will eat you. We have had no riddles for a long time. It is good to see a new riddle-master.' This scene is rich with tension and showcases the cleverness and bravery of Bilbo, as well as the dark, eerie atmosphere of Gollum's lair. The quote encapsulates the high-stakes nature of their encounter and the importance of riddles within the context of their interaction.",
    "When I think of 'The Hobbit,' one of the most memorable quotes that comes to mind is from the chapter 'Riddles in the Dark,' where Bilbo Baggins encounters Gollum. This is a crucial moment in the story, particularly when Bilbo discovers the One Ring. The quote I’m referring to is when Gollum first speaks of the ring: ''What have you got in your pocket?' he asked suddenly. Bilbo felt a little flurry of fear. He had almost forgotten the ring. He had just put it on, and he had to get back to the other side of the lake. If he told Gollum, he thought, that would be the end of his adventure, and he would have to face the goblins again.' This quote is significant because it highlights Bilbo’s precarious situation and the importance of the ring he has found. It’s a moment filled with tension and the beginning of the ring’s pivotal role in the larger story of Middle-earth.",
    "Here is a longer quote from J.R.R. Tolkien's 'The Hobbit': Then something Tookish woke up inside him, and he wished to go and see the great mountains, and hear the pine-trees and the waterfalls, and explore the caves, and wear a sword instead of a walking-stick. And he looked for a long time, but the mountains marched away into the distance; and the day came when Bilbo Baggins stuck his head out of his door after breakfast and found all the shiny things had gone. The only thing left was his pipe, and it lay on the mantelpiece; and when he went and searched, he found all his buttons and his brass knobs and his old clothes, and his tubs and his pots. 'Good gracious!' said Bilbo, and he was so flustered he was nearly dressed before he realized that he could not go in a waistcoat without buttons, or a coat with no brass buttons, or a hat with no hatband. After he had dressed in a hurry (the buttons and the hatband and the belt had taken nearly all the time, and there was a deal of sticky sticking still to be done), he ran to the door.",
    "Here is a longer quote from J.R.R. Tolkien's 'The Hobbit': 'Far over the misty mountains cold To dungeons deep and caverns old We must away ere break of day, To seek the pale enchanted gold. The dwarves of yore made mighty spells, While hammers fell like ringing bells In places deep, where dark things sleep, In hollow halls beneath the fells. For ancient king and elvish lord There many a gleaming golden hoard They shaped and wrought, and light they caught To hide in gems on hilt of sword. On silver necklaces they strung The flowering stars, on crowns they hung The dragon-fire, on twisted wire They meshed the light of moon and sun. Far over the misty mountains cold To dungeons deep and caverns old We must away, ere break of day, To claim our long-forgotten gold.' This passage captures the adventurous and mythical essence of 'The Hobbit,' evoking a sense of ancient lore and the quest for treasure that defines much of the story.",
    "Here is a longer quote from J.R.R. Tolkien's 'The Hobbit': 'It does not do to leave a live dragon out of your calculations, if you live near him. Dragons may not have much real use for all their wealth, but they know it to an ounce as a rule, especially after long possession; and Smaug was no exception. He had passed from an uneasy dream (in which a warrior, altogether insignificant in size but provided with a bitter sword and great courage, figured most unpleasantly) to a doze, and from a doze to wide waking. There was a breath of strange air in his cave. Could there be a draught from that little hole? He had never felt quite happy about it, though it was so small, and now he glared at it in suspicion and wondered why he had never blocked it up.' This quote captures the essence of the dragon Smaug's character and the sense of foreboding surrounding his presence in the story.",
    "Here is a longer quote from J.R.R. Tolkien's 'The Hobbit': 'And he lived in the days when the lands were full of dragons and the young of the earth sang and old people sat outside in the evenings and looked at the stars. And there were secrets about the world that had not been discovered, and wild woods, and strange creatures, and rare plants in unknown places. And the dragon was still in the world, and it was a dragon of the most ancient and powerful kind, and it could hear the secrets of the earth, and it could see into the hearts of men and elves. And it was a great and terrible dragon, and it was Smaug the Golden, and it had a great and wicked heart, and it was a dragon of the most ancient and powerful kind, and it could hear the secrets of the earth, and it could see into the hearts of men and elves.' This passage captures the fantastical and adventurous spirit of 'The Hobbit,' setting the stage for the epic journey that Bilbo Baggins and his companions undertake.",
    "Here is a longer quote from J.R.R. Tolkien's 'The Hobbit': 'There is more in you of good than you know, child of the kindly West. Some courage and some wisdom, blended in measure. If more of us valued food and cheer and song above hoarded gold, it would be a merrier world. But sad or merry, I must leave it now. Farewell! Then Bilbo turned away, and he went by himself, and sat alone wrapped in a blanket, and, whether you believe it or not, he wept until his eyes were red and his voice was hoarse. He was a kindly little soul. Indeed it was long before he had the heart to make a joke again. 'A mercy it is that I woke up when I did. I wish Thorin were living, but I am glad that we parted in kindness. You are a fool, Bilbo Baggins, and you made a great mess of that business with the stone; and there was a battle, in spite of all your efforts to buy peace and quiet. But I suppose you can hardly be blamed for that.'"
