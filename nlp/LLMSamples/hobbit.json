    "One of the most iconic and extensive quotes that comes to mind from The Hobbit is the opening passage, which sets the tone for the entire story. It introduces us to the peaceful, comfortable life of Bilbo Baggins before he is swept up into the adventure of a lifetime: 'In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.' This quote is significant because it encapsulates the essence of Bilbo's character and his world. The hobbit-hole represents safety, coziness, and contentment—qualities that Bilbo values deeply at the beginning of the tale. This imagery also contrasts sharply with the dangers and discomforts he will face on his journey, highlighting his transformation from a reluctant adventurer to a courageous hero.",
    "This passage is also beloved by readers because of its simple yet evocative language, which draws them into Tolkien's richly imagined world right from the start. When I think of The Hobbit, one of the most memorable and extensive quotes that immediately comes to mind is Bilbo's riddle to Gollum during their famous riddle game in the dark tunnels beneath the Misty Mountains. This particular quote stands out because of its simplicity and the significance it carries in the story. It goes like this: 'This thing all things devours: Birds, beasts, trees, flowers; Gnaws iron, bites steel;Grinds hard stones to meal; Slays king, ruins town, And beats high mountain down.' The answer to the riddle is 'Time,' and it’s a pivotal moment in the book. This riddle encapsulates the idea that time is a force that affects everything and everyone, including Bilbo and Gollum. The scene itself is iconic, as it leads to Bilbo's acquisition of the One Ring, which becomes central not only to The Hobbit but to The Lord of the Rings trilogy as well. Additionally, the riddle game is a key turning point for Bilbo, where his wits and cleverness save his life, marking the beginning of his transformation from a simple hobbit into a resourceful and courageous adventurer.",
    "One of the most memorable and often-quoted passages from The Hobbit is the description of the entrance to the Lonely Mountain, which also introduces the riddle of the secret door. This passage captures the sense of mystery, adventure, and the deep history that permeates Tolkien's world: 'Standing near was a great stone with a thrush sitting on it, and as the sun was sinking, it released a piercing note, as if it had been a signal. And as if in answer, down from the mountain fell a single ray of red light through the opening. By its light, Bilbo saw the grey stone in the grass that held a hidden keyhole. Then Thorin stepped forward and drew the key that had been given him, and he put it in the hole. It fitted perfectly. Then he turned it and the door swung open, and they all passed through.' This passage is iconic because it marks the moment when the quest reaches its climax. The description is rich with symbolism: the thrush, the keyhole revealed by the setting sun, and the hidden door all contribute to the magical realism that defines Tolkien's work. The scene is filled with tension and expectation, perfectly capturing the sense of discovery and adventure that drives The Hobbit.",
    "One of the most memorable and extensive quotes from The Hobbit that often comes to mind is the iconic riddle spoken by Gollum during the famous Riddles in the Dark chapter: 'This thing all things devours: Birds, beasts, trees, flowers; Gnaws iron, bites steel; Grinds hard stones to meal; Slays king, ruins town, And beats high mountain down.' This riddle is particularly striking because it encapsulates the eerie and sinister atmosphere of Gollum's lair, the cunning and tension between Gollum and Bilbo, and the timelessness of the themes in Tolkien's work. The answer to the riddle is 'Time,' which is a concept that resonates deeply with the themes of change, aging, and the inevitable passage of time that permeates The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. This passage also exemplifies Tolkien's mastery of language and his ability to weave profound truths into the fabric of his storytelling, making it one of the most memorable quotes from the book.",
    "The quote that often comes to mind from The Hobbit is Bilbo Baggins' reflection on his journey and the nature of adventures. This passage captures the essence of the unexpected journey he embarked on and how it changed him. Here's the detailed quote: 'This is a story of how a Baggins had an adventure, and found himself doing and saying things altogether unexpected. He may have lost the neighbours’ respect, but he gained—well, you will see whether he gained anything in the end.' This quote is from the early part of the book, setting the tone for Bilbo's transformation from a comfort-loving hobbit into a brave adventurer. It encapsulates the theme of personal growth and the idea that adventures, while disruptive and challenging, lead to profound change and self-discovery. Another iconic quote that stands out, especially towards the end of the story, is when Bilbo reflects on the nature of home and the value of simple pleasures: 'If more of us valued food and cheer and song above hoarded gold, it would be a merrier world.' This quote is a powerful commentary on the themes of greed, wealth, and the simple joys of life, which resonate throughout the narrative, particularly in the context of the dragon Smaug's hoard and the conflicts that arise from it.",
    "One of the most iconic and extensive quotes from The Hobbit that comes to mind is the description of Bilbo's home in the opening chapter. It beautifully captures the cozy and inviting atmosphere of the Shire, setting the stage for the entire adventure: 'In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort. It had a perfectly round door like a porthole, painted green, with a shiny yellow brass knob in the exact middle. The door opened on to a tube-shaped hall like a tunnel: a very comfortable tunnel without smoke, with paneled walls, and floors tiled and carpeted, provided with polished chairs, and lots and lots of pegs for hats and coats – the hobbit was fond of visitors.' This passage not only introduces the reader to the homely and charming world of Bilbo Baggins but also subtly reflects the theme of comfort versus adventure that runs throughout the novel. Bilbo's home is a place of warmth and safety, a stark contrast to the wild and perilous journey he is about to embark on. The detailed description of the hobbit-hole, with its emphasis on comfort and order, serves as a perfect entry point into the world of Middle-earth.",
    "When I think of The Hobbit, the first quote that comes to mind is from the beginning of the book, when J.R.R. Tolkien introduces us to Bilbo Baggins and the comfort of his home: 'In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.'

The detailed description of the hobbit-hole is rich with imagery, making it easy to visualize the snug, welcoming environment that Bilbo is so reluctant to leave.",
    "When I think of The Hobbit, the first quote that comes to mind is from Chapter 1, 'An Unexpected Party.' It's the moment when Bilbo Baggins, completely overwhelmed by the sudden arrival of dwarves in his cozy hobbit hole, expresses his dismay. The quote encapsulates Bilbo’s initial reluctance to leave the comfort of his home and venture into the unknown. Here’s the detailed passage: 'We don’t want any adventures here, thank you! You might try over The Hill or across The Water.' By this he meant that the conversation was at an end. This line is emblematic of Bilbo's character at the beginning of the story—an ordinary hobbit, fond of his quiet life, who has no interest in the dangerous and unpredictable world outside of the Shire. His polite but firm rejection of the idea of adventure contrasts sharply with the epic journey he eventually undertakes, making it a power",
     "When I think of The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien, a particularly memorable quote that comes to mind is from Bilbo Baggins’ encounter with Gollum in the dark depths of the Misty Mountains. This passage is famous for Bilbo’s discovery of the One Ring and his clever use of riddles to outwit Gollum: 'This is the riddle-game. Riddles are all we have to play with,' said Gollum. 'And I will be a riddle master. You have a good head on your shoulders, I can see that. You will have to answer the riddles in turn, or I will eat you. We have had no riddles for a long time. It is good to see a new riddle-master.' This scene is rich with tension and showcases the cleverness and bravery of Bilbo, as well as the dark, eerie atmosphere of Gollum's lair. The quote encapsulates the high-stakes nature of their encounter and the importance of riddles within the context of their interaction.",
    "When I think of 'The Hobbit,' one of the most memorable quotes that comes to mind is from the chapter 'Riddles in the Dark,' where Bilbo Baggins encounters Gollum. This is a crucial moment in the story, particularly when Bilbo discovers the One Ring. The quote I’m referring to is when Gollum first speaks of the ring: ''What have you got in your pocket?' he asked suddenly. Bilbo felt a little flurry of fear. He had almost forgotten the ring. He had just put it on, and he had to get back to the other side of the lake. If he told Gollum, he thought, that would be the end of his adventure, and he would have to face the goblins again.' This quote is significant because it highlights Bilbo’s precarious situation and the importance of the ring he has found. It’s a moment filled with tension and the beginning of the ring’s pivotal role in the larger story of Middle-earth."
