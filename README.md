Exponential Length Substrings in Pattern Matching

This paper describes a hash-based mass-searching algorithm, finding (count, location of first match)
entries from a dictionary against a string s of length n. The presented implementation makes use
of all substrings of s whose lengths are powers of 2 to construct an offline algorithm that can, in
some cases, reach a complexity of O(n log^2 n) even if there are O(n^2) possible matches. If there is a
limit on the dictionary size m, then the complexity is bounded by O(n âˆšm log n), even if it performs
better in practice.
