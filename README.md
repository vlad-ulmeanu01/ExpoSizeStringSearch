Exponential Length Substrings in Pattern Matching

This note describes a hash-based mass-searching algorithm, finding (count, location of first match) entries from a dictionary against a string $s$ of length $n$. The presented implementation makes use of all substrings of $s$ whose lengths are powers of $2$ to construct an offline algorithm that can, in some cases, reach a complexity of $O(n \log^2n)$ even if there are $O(n^2)$ possible matches. If there is a limit on the dictionary size $m$, then the precomputation complexity is $O(m + n \log^2n)$, and the search complexity is bounded by $O(n\log^2n + m\log n)$, even if it performs in practice like $O(n\log^2n + \sqrt{nm}\log n)$. Other applications, such as finding the number of distinct substrings of $s$ for each length between $1$ and $n$, can be done with the same algorithm in $O(n\log^2n)$.
